# Protocol Overview

![protocol](/img/overview.png)
<br></br>

Noox is a protocol on Ethereum that aims to build a decentralized proof of achievement platform designed for publishing, proving, and minting on-chain achievements in a permissionless way. Through the platform, users are able to discover on-chain achievements curated by the community and mint them as non-transferable NFTs called ‘Badges’.

### Smart Contract and Validating Oracle

Noox Protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts and a validating oracle to provide composable badges and built-in on-chain data validation. Publisher of a badge can deploy specific badge standards—which includes detailed metadata of the on-chain achievement and eligibility criteria—to the blockchain. When a user attempts to claim a badge, Noox’s validating oracle—which fetches and synchronizes Ethereum blockchain data—provides proof for the Noox Protocol by analyzing the user’s historic transaction data and validating whether or not the user is eligible.

### Future Roadmap

We focused on providing users with the ability to claim badges as a proof of achievement during our first closed beta in May, 2022.  We will be introducing a publishing platform and related features in the coming months. As a future roadmap, Noox Protocol has plans to implement $NOOX economics and governance system to distribute the ownership of the protocol to contributors.

Noox aims to contribute to the creation of a more collaborative and meritocratic network where one’s contribution, participation, and reputation is valued. As a result, the Noox Protocol is, by design, community-driven, contribution-first, and on-chain based system that could shape the fabric of how Web3 users interact and how applications and protocols are built to understand them.
