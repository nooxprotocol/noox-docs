# Why is Noox Interesting?

### Why is Noox Badge interesting?
We believe understanding user’s on-chain interactions and footprints is going to be the most important means of describing yourself in the Web3 world. Level of contributions, achievements, and other stats related to the crypto world are important to crypto users and communities. Noox Badge eliminates the cost of leveraging those achievements and provides a totally new way of building web3 status in a crypto-friendly manner. 

In this context, the importance of Noox Badge is two fold: proof of on-achievement and composable social lego as a community building block

### Proof of on-chain achievement

Traditionally, achievements are included within games to provide players with the impetus to do more than simply complete the game, motivate players to maximize their own general score, and let them obtain recognition for their performance due to the publication of their achievement/trophy profiles. Therefore, unlocking achievements by building good stats, rankings, and performances plays an important role in forming the profile for players, expressing themselves in-game or outside of the game, and providing quantitative proof. 

The same goes for the crypto space as well. Noox Badge provides quantitative proof of the user's actual on-chain experience by validating on-chain transactions. By unlocking badges, users can gain impetus to use a protocol, maximize their reputation score, and obtain community recognition. Additionally, Noox Badge is specialized in demonstrating achievements related to on-chain protocols since it focuses purely on on-chain validation, not off-chain stuff. Therefore, Noox Badge is the best solution for discovering, organizing, and gamifying achievements related to more on-chain protocols. One of our long-term goals is to make Noox Badge a sophisticated achievement system by organizing all of the major achievements on-chain. This will make the uses of Noox Badge more sharp and specific.

### Composable building blocks as a social primitive

Since an on-chain account has no labels and tags to explain itself with ease, Noox Badge could be a unique identifier for indicating one’s attributes, interests, and achievements in a specific category in crypto space, and thus it could be composable building blocks as a social primitive when it comes to networking with crypto natives and building a crypto community.

Retrospective airdropping is one of the examples explaining why identifying a certain attribute of users is important in terms of building a crypto community. With a Noox Badge, the crypto community is able to identify users without additional cost and users are able to identify each other via social or community interfaces/frameworks or Noox apps. 

Through unlimited composability given by the nature of blockchain, Noox Badges can be natively integrated with other protocols without any other extra efforts, any permissions, so it could fuel decentralized innovation driven by individuals and communities.
