# Upgrade Badge

## Introducing Series and Badge Upgrade

Noox offers publishers the ability to create progressive badges called 'Series' that are meant to represent one's progression into a particular achievement system.

<Figure caption="Ethereum User Series" src="/img/ethereumUserSeries.png"/>

A publisher can create a ‘Series’ consisting of multiple leveled badges for a given action. These levels are hierarchical and each level can be determined freely based on certain action factors like the total amount or number of actions. Once a series badge is claimed, users can upgrade the badge to a higher-level badge when they reach the next achievement milestones. 

In the process of upgrading the badge, a lower-level badge is burned and replaced with a higher-level badge. There is no additional fee for upgrading badges except for the gas fee.

:::note
If you have claimed 2 or more of the below badge series before the feature update, you will be reimbursed for all previous minting fees, except for the first minting fee in a given series. The reimbursement will be made automatically if/when you upgrade your badge.

## How Upgrade Works

![upgrade1](/img/upgrade1.png)

If you have the ‘Ethereum Rare User’ badge and met all the requirements for the next level badge, you can upgrade your existing badge to the ‘Ethereum Super Rare User’ badge. 

![upgrade2](/img/upgrade2.png)

The ‘Upgrade’ button can be found on the detail page of a badge. Make sure to click ‘check eligibility’ to see if you are eligible for an upgrade. After clicking ‘Upgrade’, you will need to confirm this transaction on your MetaMask for the process to be completed. 

![upgrade3](/img/upgrade3.png)

Once the upgrade is completed, your previous 'Ethereum Rare User' badge will be burned and replaced with the 'Ethereum Super Rare User' badge.

## Migration

### Introducing badge version migration 
All Noox badges are published to blockchain, therefore, if certain metadata needs to be revised, the publisher needs to re-publish the badge with the revised metadata.

There are a few instances when it is necessary for publishers to update the badge version.
- Case 1: If badge information is incorrect (e.g. incorrect contract address)
- Case 2: If projects add and/or migrate to a new smart contract (e.g. OpenSea’s decision to move from Wyvern to Seaport)

Protocols can make note of this version change and allow users to migrate to the new badge version. If a user chooses to migrate to a new badge version, the old version badge will be burned. In addition, upon the release of the new version, the old version will no longer be claimable. The migration process is free of charge except for the gas fee.
