# Vision & Way Forward

Ultimately, Noox protocol aims to build permissionless, community-driven, and decentralized universal proof of achievement layer for the web3 ecosystem. As a future roadmap, Noox protocol has a plan to implement $NOOX economics and its governance system to distribute the ownership of the protocol to contributors who participate in building the rich-context ecosystem and eliminate the necessity of a central authority in decision making process. We will continuously gather feedback from the community and share the progress once weâ€™re ready via our community channels.
